#  Middleware
Middlewares can be seeing either as high-level capabilities, or as hidden service. They have dependencies
on capabilities, but are not directly accessed by the GUI.

Some examples are :
* active synchronisation between local data and server side.
* logging component to monitor the engine and send data to a server.
